Respect Project
===============
 
Simple independent components for building or improving applications.

About this repository
---------------------

This is a repository for the Respect project itself, its philosofy, 
general issues concerning multiple Respect projects, the team and everything 
else that doesn't fit on other specific repositories.

Our Principles
--------------

- Keep it small and simple.
- Clean interfaces. Easy to learn, a pleasure to use.
- Work together with PHP. Don't try to change it, don't try to hide it.
- Everything tested. We aim at 100% code coverage, 100% continuous integration.
- No code generation. You shouldn't have to maintain code you don't write.
- Our docs reflects our unit tests, naturally.
- Meritocracy based. Wanna join our team? Contribute like a happy panda.

The Components
--------------

- **[Validation](http://github.com/Respect/Validation)**, the most awesome validation engine ever created for PHP.
- **[Config](http://github.com/Respect/Config)**, a tool for managing configuration and dependencies.
- **[Rest](http://github.com/Respect/Rest)**, a thin controller for RESTful applications.
- **[Doc](http://github.com/Respect/Doc)**, generates documentation that rocks you sock off.
- **[Relational](http://github.com/Respect/Relational)**, the easiest relational database toolkit.
- **[Structural](http://github.com/Respect/Structural)**, the easiest document-oriented database toolkit.
- **[Template](http://github.com/Respect/Template)**, pure HTML/CSS templates.
- **[Loader](http://github.com/Respect/Loader)**, lightweight PHP class autoloading.

Also, there are two meta-projects:

- **[Foundation](http://github.com/Respect/Foundation)**, a project template for us and everyone.
- **[Data](http://github.com/Respect/Data)**, a common model for collection-based data.
